    <h4 id="raelys">A better API for lodestone data</h4>
    <p>
        Please consider checking out <a href="https://github.com/mattantonelli/lodestone/wiki">Raelys' Lodestone API</a>.
        It is the API that powers the <a href="http://na.lodestone.raelys.com/">Lodestone News</a> Discord service, and has
        much more consistent and cleaner data than the current XIVAPI endpoints, including start/end dates for maintenance times.
