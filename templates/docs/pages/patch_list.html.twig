    <h1>Patch List</h1>

    <h6>CURRENTLY UNSUPPORTED</h6>

    <p>
        Patch information on XIVAPI is currently in "Limbo" status. This is because it the system I originally
        built is unreliable as part of the update pipeline. For the release of 5.0 I will be building a
        side-project that manages patch values and using this to back-port all content on XIVAPI.
    </p>

    <hr>

    {{ docs.api('/patchlist', '/patchlist') }}
    <p>
        The API keeps a track record of when a piece of content is updated, this is based on which
        patch version the ID appears; ignoring all "dummy" rows. This patch list is handled manually
        and has been curated over many years. Work is in progress to ensure an accurate patch version
        for all current game files.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can keep a hash of this patch list to know if any new data has been added to the API.
    </p>

    <p>
        This patch list will not be accurate for Korean or Chinese game content.
